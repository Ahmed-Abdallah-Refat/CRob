Recently we've:
* Switched the server storage medium from .JSON files to SQLite3 (through [quick.db](https://quickdb.js.org/))

* Started removing server data to stop servers you can no longer modify appearing in the [Web Dashboard](https://github.com/tascord/CRob-Module-Collection/tree/master/web-dashboard)

* Added a [licence](https://github.com/tascord/CRob/blob/master/LICENCE.md)

* Laid the groundwork for a currency and shop system, development for this should start soon on the [beta](https://github.com/tascord/CRob/tree/beta) branch

* Condensed the help command, allowing for more commands to be stored

* Removed empty fields from _commands.json
